Hello, %username%!

I created a calculator with the basic functions, including:   
1. Multiply.    
2. Add.   
3. Subtract.    
4. Divide.    
5. Square root.   
6. Percentage.    

I implemented a calculator in C++, using the 'switch-case' statement.   
You might ask, why i'm used 'switch-case' statement?    
Because, 'switch-case' statement is convenient and concise alternative to the 'if-else' statement.
